# Road-Damage-Detection
This project implements automated pothole detection using a pretrained YOLO model with Ultralytics in Google Colab. It uses OpenCV for image processing, Pandas for data handling, and Folium for map visualization. The system detects road damage, draws bounding boxes, and supports smart city infrastructure monitoring.
